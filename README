Lab Solutions:
• Lab2_Solutions.R
Focus: This lab involves statistical analysis using various summary statistics and visualizations. The exercises include calculating measures of central tendency, dispersion, and creating histograms.
• Lab3_Solutions.R
Focus: This lab focuses on probability distributions, including normal distribution and binomial distribution. It covers calculating probabilities, expected values, and standard deviations using R functions.
• Lab4_Solutions.R
Focus: The lab is centered around hypothesis testing, particularly t-tests. It includes performing one-sample and two-sample t-tests, interpreting p-values, and discussing the implications of the results.
• Lab5_Solutions.R
Focus: This lab deals with correlation and regression analysis. It covers calculating correlation coefficients, fitting linear regression models, and interpreting the coefficients and R-squared values.
• Lab6_Solutions.R
Focus: The lab explores the concepts of ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). It includes performing one-way ANOVA tests to compare means across multiple groups and understanding the F-statistic and p-values.
• Lab7_Solutions.R
Focus: This lab covers chi-squared tests for independence. It includes creating contingency tables, calculating expected frequencies, and interpreting chi-squared statistics.
• Lab8_Solutions.R
Focus: The lab focuses on logistic regression analysis. It covers fitting logistic regression models, interpreting the coefficients, and assessing the model's predictive power using ROC curves.
• Lab9_Solutions.R
Focus: This lab involves non-parametric statistical tests, including the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. It emphasizes situations where these tests are appropriate compared to their parametric counterparts.
• Lab10_Solutions.R
Focus: The final lab covers advanced topics in regression, including polynomial regression and interaction effects. It includes model selection techniques and validation methods to assess model performance.
